# mastermind
# Project Description: Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computer’s random code.
# Parts of the game include: 
- 6 possible numbers to make the guess code with
- A secret code composed of 4 numbers in a particular order (generated by Human Player and AI)
- 12 turns to win or the game ends
- 4 peg hint slots, '★' to show correct number/correct position, '☆' to show correct number/incorrect position (order of stars is irrelevant)
# Notes:
-Separate game logic from other classes
-Separate GUI/board display logic
-Separate AI logic
-Separate hint peg slots logic
-Make sure hint logic matches guess 1:1 (I.E. if secret code has 1 'Red' peg and my guess has two 'Red' pegs, hint section should only return one 'White' peg)
-The hint pegs may be special characters
-Code can be any combination of 1-6 (I.E. all 1, two 2/two 4, all different etc.)
-'Color pegs' will be integers
